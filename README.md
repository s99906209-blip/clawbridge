**ClawBridge** is the definitive **Mobile Dashboard** for OpenClaw agents. It serves as your pocket-sized **Mission Control**—monitor real-time thoughts, track token costs, and manage background tasks from anywhere, securely and instantly.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **📱 Mobile-First Dashboard**: Optimized for phone screens. View logs, stats, and controls without squinting.
*   **🧠 Live Activity Feed**: Watch your agent "think" and execute tools in real-time. Features intelligent parallel logging (no missed background tasks) and deduplication.
*   **💰 Token Economy**: Track daily/monthly LLM costs and usage trends. Know exactly where your money goes.
*   **🔍 [Cost Control Center](docs/cost-control-center.md)**: 10 automated diagnostics that scan your usage, calculate savings, and let you apply optimizations with one tap. Cut API costs by 30–90%.
*   **📜 Memory Timeline**: Browse your agent's daily journals and long-term memory evolution.
*   **🚀 Mission Control**: Trigger cron jobs, restart services, or kill runaway scripts directly from the UI.
*   **⚡ Zero-Config Remote**: 
    *   **Auto-Port**: Automatically finds an available port if 3000 is busy.
    *   **Smart Networking**: Auto-detects **Tailscale/WireGuard** for direct secure access.
    *   **Quick Tunnel**: If no VPN is found, auto-generates a temporary public URL via Cloudflare (Zero Config).

## 🚀 Installation

Run this one-liner on your OpenClaw server (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
curl -sL https://clawbridge.app/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. The script will:
1.  Detect your environment (VPN or Public).
2.  Generate a secure Access Key.
3.  Give you a ready-to-use URL.

## 📱 Usage

### 1. Zero-Config Access (Default)
If you just want to try it out, the installer provides a **Quick Tunnel** URL:
`https://<random-name>.trycloudflare.com/?key=<YOUR_KEY>`

*   **Pros**: Instant access from anywhere.
*   **Cons**: URL changes if you restart the service.

### 2. VPN Direct Access (Privacy First)
If **Tailscale** or **WireGuard** is detected, the installer skips the public tunnel and gives you a private link:
`http://<VPN_IP>:3000/?key=<YOUR_KEY>`

*   **Pros**: Fastest speed, maximum privacy.
*   **Cons**: Your phone must be connected to the VPN.

### 3. Permanent Public Domain (Advanced)
Want a fixed URL like `dash.yoursite.com`?
1.  Obtain a **Cloudflare Tunnel Token** from [Cloudflare Dash \> Networking \> Tunnels](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/tunnels).
2.  Run the installer with the token:
    ```bash
    cd skills/clawbridge
    ./install.sh --token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
    ```
    *   Or force a new Quick Tunnel: `./install.sh --force-cf`
3.  After the installation is successful, go back to the Cloudflare Tunnel's **Public Hostname** (or **Routes**) page and click **Add a public hostname** to bind your own domain to `localhost:3000` for permanent access.

### 4. Docker (Containerized)
You can run ClawBridge as a Docker container. The images are automatically published to the [GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)](https://github.com/dreamwing/clawbridge/pkgs/container/clawbridge).
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dreamwing/clawbridge:latest
docker run -d --name clawbridge \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key \
  -e OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/openclaw \
  -e OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE=/openclaw/workspace \
  -v ~/.openclaw:/openclaw:ro \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/dreamwing/clawbridge:latest
```

## 📱 Mobile App (PWA)
1.  Open the dashboard in Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android).
2.  Tap "Share" -> "Add to Home Screen".
3.  Launch it like a native app (full screen, no browser bar).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Backend**: Node.js (Express, WebSocket) - Lightweight sidecar process.
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla JS - Zero build step, instant load.
*   **Tunnel**: Cloudflared
